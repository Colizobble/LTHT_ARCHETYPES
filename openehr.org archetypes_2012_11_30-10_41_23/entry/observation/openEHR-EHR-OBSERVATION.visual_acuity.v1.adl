			use = <"Use to record the results of measurement of visual acuity, for both near and distance testing.

The 'Clinical Description' data element can be used to record simple narrative summary or as a means to integrate legacy data. 

Detailed, structured visual acuity results are preferred and are generally recorded for each eye in turn.  A set of measurements carried out during the same test procedure but using differing corrective refractions or other patient states may be recorded by using a series of Visual Acuity Measurement events, possibly using run-time naming or coding of each event e.g. '| SNOMEDCT::420050001 | Uncorrected Visual Acuity |'.

The 'Absent Test Result' element may be used to record circumstances where a test could not be performed or completed. Further details may be recorded under 'Confounding Factors' or 'Additional Comment'.">
